## **Context**

This approach is intended to guide decision-making within a technical team, and can cover decisions as varied as design choices, vendor selection, or staff hiring. It is an “approach” instead of a “process” because it intends to set guidelines that can be adapted to each situation, rather than a rigid prescription that could cause excessive work or awkwardness.

**Why do we need an approach for making decisions?**

In a culture with [high deference to authority](https://strategycapstone.org/high-power-distance-culture/), aka high power-distance, decisions are made by a few people in positions of authority. The hierarchical nature of corporations reinforces a high deference culture and a bias towards quick results. However, tough technical decisions demand low deference to authority so problems and unfamiliar perspectives can be surfaced and options deliberated. A decision-making approach attempts to balance these demands. See: The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes (Ch.7), Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell, 2008

## **Use this approach for significant decisions**

A *significant decision* can be one of:

* having impact beyond the team (i.e. large blast radius);

* having long-term cost implications (i.e. strains the budget); or

* is difficult to unwind if there is a problem (i.e. a [one-way door](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/decision-making-using-one-two-way-doors-niro-nirmalan/) decision).

## **Push down non-significant decision-making**

If you can’t categorize a decision as significant, don’t hinder progress with a process when the stakes are low. Simply assign the *decision-maker* role to a person closest to the issue. The decision-maker for a non-significant decision should take the initiative to have their material reviewed by others early in the development process, not just at code review time.

:exclamation: **The more you can break down large problems into non-significant problems, the faster your team will go.**

The remainder of this approach will be considering significant decisions.

## **Setting up a decision for success**

It is always fair to ask:

* Do we *really* need to make this decision?

* Does this decision need to be made *now*?

* Who are the *stakeholders* that will have responsibility for the decision’s outcome?

* Who are the *dependents* that will be impacted by the decision’s outcome?

* Who are key *consultants* that hold important perspectives, and hold important counter-perspectives, that we should consult with when making this decision?

## **Making significant decisions**

Significant decisions are made by:

* involving all team members that can contribute meaningfully;

* encouraging all participants to be critical in their thinking, vocal in their criticisms, open-minded in considering alternatives, and respectful of all viewpoints;

* reaching out to external stakeholders, dependents, and consultants to ensure their involvement, or at the very least to keep them informed; and

* converging to the team decision through consensus building, addressing all concerns.

How many people should be involved in making a decision? [The optimal number is 7 \+/- 2](https://labs.la.utexas.edu/gilden/files/2016/04/MagicNumberSeven-Miller1956.pdf).

## **Explore options early**

It is best to explore options early in decision-making when it is much less costly than trying to recover from the consequences of taking a bad option. Considering a broader set of options right from the start can lead to deeper understanding and better outcomes because unfamiliar approaches may be uncovered. This wider perspective helps us honestly confront our own biases.

Often there will be one or two overwhelming **positive** factors that quickly move an option to the top of the list and present evaluation criteria against which other options can be quickly measured and eliminated.

There may also emerge one or two overwhelming **negative** factors that render an option infeasible which then allows you to eliminate that option, and the quicker you can identify these factors the more time you can spend understanding the most promising options.

## **Decisions in a writing culture**

:exclamation: **A decision doesn’t exist unless it is written.**

Nominate one person \- *the decision lead* \- to prepare a *decision-making document* that includes:

* **named parties** including stakeholders, dependents, and consultants;

* **context** including relevant project history, range of consequences, constraints, and costs;

* **rationale** including investigation results, evidence, measurements, and analysis;

* **options** including a decision not to decide, and acquiring capability instead of building it;

* **risks** in selecting one option versus another; and

* **recommendation** as a strongly held position considering all of the above.

Does a recommendation corrupt the thinking of the team? Some decisions may best be made without a recommendation, however it’s important to consider how it forces the decision lead to dive deeply enough into each option to form an opinion based on evidence.

During decision-making, the document should memorialize all comments and edits. Upon completion of a decision, the decision-making document is updated to explain the decision with full consideration for any dissenting viewpoints.

Such a decision-making document may be an established component of some other process if that produces a document containing similar content.

## **Driving to consensus**

The key benefits of [driving to consensus](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/workplace-communication/building-consensus/) are to:

 uncover our [biases](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/decision-making-biases) so we can confront them;

* balance between taking quick action and considering a problem deeply;

* maximize the team’s acceptance and ownership of the decision; and

* minimize individual reluctance to accept the decision.

A significant decision should be made in a group session with all interested parties. Appoint the decision lead to moderate the session, or another person to act as the *moderator*. Start the session with a quiet review of the decision-making document, encouraging participants to enter comments into the document. Then start a review period where the moderator leads consideration of all comments with civil debate, and attempts to solicit input from all participants.

:exclamation: **The decision is made when consensus is achieved, which is the point where team members no longer have objections, although they may have disagreements or unresolved questions.**

This decision point does not require a single person to act as a decision-maker, but enables a team to take ownership of its decisions. If consensus cannot be reached, the team manager should make the decision. Do not use a simple-majority voting system to make a decision because that can result in a decision without consensus \- this is less effective than a manager in a position of authority making a decision.

Perhaps the art in driving consensus is in knowing when the effort has been good enough. Sometimes an agreed time limit helps to constrain the investment to an amount commensurate with the problem to be solved. Spending too much time analyzing information that doesn’t materially contribute to the decision is just wasted effort and project delay. The project risks and potential costs are likely the most powerful indicators of the value of deep analysis in decision-making.

## **Moderating a review session**

The best practice is to hold one session to review all aspects of the decision, and then plan a second session for the actual decision. This gives team members a chance to reflect more deeply on the material and to consult one another, making consensus building easier. It can also reduce the friction on a particularly contentious topic.

Review sessions work best when people are gathered, but can also work when people are on a call, or can be done completely offline by individuals reviewing and commenting in the decision-making document and the moderator reviewing all comments.

It it critical to appreciate that in complex situations, one person may hold the key with a piece of information that transforms the entire perspective of the problem, and it is quite possible that person is not comfortable speaking up because that may involve challenging the group as it is forming consensus, or challenging an authority figure. It is also common for an individual with strongly held views to dominate the discussion while ignoring other important facts and perspectives.

Therefore the moderator should engage all people having strongly held positions, whether they be quiet or loud, and try to resolve these differences with an open-minded spirit of learning, and not one of pushing a decision in order to be “right” on the issue.

## **Disagreement and commitment**

The best decisions are made by unanimous agreement from a team, and the purpose of driving to consensus is to arrive at unanimous agreement, or nearly unanimous agreement.

Upon leaving a review session, all participants have the responsibility to express their disagreements. The team should try to resolve disagreements within a review session, or create action items to follow-up for resolution of disagreements.

When the team has arrived at a decision, as individuals we may disagree with the decision but we commit as a team to follow the decision.

Corporations are not democracies. If a manager in a position of authority hands down a decision, or overrules a decision, we have a responsibility to follow the authority even if we disagree. That manager not only has authority, but may hold a perspective that the team can’t see.

## **Outcomes and decision history**

:exclamation: **A well-made decision may have a bad outcome, and a poorly made decision may have a good outcome. Since an outcome will be affected by events occurring after the decision, it is not helpful to judge the quality of a decision by its outcome.**

What determines if a decision was good or bad, and how good is our approach for making decisions? It is useful, from time to time, to hold a retrospective on a past decision.

There is probably some information that emerged after a decision that was critical in determining the outcome and which may have been unknown to the participants prior to the decision. The key question is whether such information was then *knowable*, in which case the team should consider how to improve their processes to find and resolve critical *unknown yet knowable* factors as early as possible.
